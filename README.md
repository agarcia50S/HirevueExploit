# Overview
## Project Summary
The purpose of this repo is to help you prepare for a Hirevue one-way video interview by providing you with the questions that will be asked. Hirevue's interview-session page contains a design that the program exploits to gain access to the interview questions prior to the interview. The idea for my project was inspired by a repo I found called [firevue](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue) which was authored by [lightflix](https://github.com/lightflix). My project expands on lightflix's work by using a novel approach to access the interviw questions with mininal user input.
## Functionality
The module is composed of 2 main component: a webscraper and a Command Line Interface (CLI). 

The webscraper part uses `requests` to access a JSON file that contains the interview questions. Then it uses the `json` module to parse the JSON file for each question and its recording parameters (e.g. response and preparation times). For some users, the questions are rail-fence encrypted, so a refactored version of lightflix's ([decryption algorithm](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue/blob/main/firevue.py)) is used.

Once the questions and recording parameters have been parsed and cleaned, they are sent to the CLI component. The CLI gives the user control over the program; it provides a variety of options that allow the user alter the program's functionality (e.g. display quesions, save questions, alter the GET request, and more). The `argparse` module is used to create the CLI.
