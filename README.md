The purpose of this repo is help you prepare for a Hirevue one-way video interview by providing you with the questions that will be asked.

The script is very simple. It accesses a JSON file that the website uses to configure the interview question sections. Specifically, it accesses the questions that will be asked in the interview and details about each question and presents them to the user in a readable format. 

#### Work in progress. 

* The script requires the user to have 2 pieces of information.
  1. The API URL that the JSON file is located at. 

  2. The Authorization header values (i.e. scheme type and token value)

  - (To access this information the user will need to use their brower's Dev Tools to view the website's HTTP requests.)

* In the coming days I will make 3 main changes: 
  1. I will simplify the user set-up process, such that only the Interview Code will need to be entered.

  2. Add more detailed documentation
  
  3. Add a CLI feature
