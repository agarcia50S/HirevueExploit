# Overview
## Project Summary
The purpose of this repo is help you prepare for a Hirevue one-way video interview by providing you with the questions that will be asked. The [view_questions]() module presents the user with the interview questions by exploiting a design flaw in the interview session webpage. The idea for my project was inspired by a repo I found called [firevue](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue) which was authored by [lightflix](https://github.com/lightflix). My project expands on lightflix's work by using a novel approach to access the interviw questions with mininal user input.
## Functionality
The module is composed of 2 main component: a webscraper and a Command Line Interface (CLI). 

The webscraper part uses `requests` to access a JSON file that contains the interview questions. Then it uses the `json` module to parse the JSON file for each question and its recording parameters (e.g. response and preparation times). For some user's the question's have rail fence encryption, so a refactored version of lightflix's ([decryption algorithm](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue/blob/main/firevue.py)) is used.

Once the questions and recording parameters have been parsed and cleaned, they are sent to the CLI component where are formatted for visual display. The `argparse` module is used to create the CLI.
# Background
HirVue is a company that created an interviewing platform designed to automate part of the interviewing process for employeers. Their platform includes web-based software that facilates one-way / one-sided interviews. The candidate recieves an "invitation" via email that contains a link to the website where their response's to a series of interview questions are recorded.

While preparing for a HireView interview I came across a Reddit post claiming one could view the interview questions prior to starting the interview. The post claimed that if one used their browser's developer tools to inspect the page's website activity, one could prematurely access the interviews questions. It turned out that the claim is true.

When a GET request is sent to the emailed interview URL (e.g.https://company.hirevue.com/interviews/interview-code/), the HTML that is sent back contains JavaScript that uses an XMLhttpRequest object to send a GET request to access a JSON file. The JSON file contains the interview questions and configuration details (e.g. recording legnth, question count, etc.) about them. 

Out of curiousity, I tried sending the GET request myself using the python `requests` module and it actually worked. This lead to wonder if the python community had created a program around this vulnerability. And as expected, someone created a program with CLI so that anyone could easily exploit this vulnerability. The creator is [lightflix](https://github.com/lightflix) and their cheeky-named program is [firevue](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue).


The script is very simple. It accesses a JSON file that the website uses to configure the interview question sections. Specifically, it accesses the questions that will be asked in the interview and details about each question and presents them to the user in a readable format. 

#### Work in progress. 

* The script requires the user to have 2 pieces of information.
  1. The API URL that the JSON file is located at. 

  2. The Authorization header values (i.e. scheme type and token value)

  - (To access this information the user will need to use their brower's Dev Tools to view the website's HTTP requests.)

* In the coming days I will make 3 main changes: 
  1. I will simplify the user set-up process, such that only the Interview Code will need to be entered.

  2. Add more detailed documentation
  
  3. Add a CLI feature
