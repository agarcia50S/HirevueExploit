# Overview
## Project Summary
The purpose of this repo is help you prepare for a Hirevue one-way video interview by providing you with the questions that will be asked. The [view_questions]() module presents the user with the interview questions by exploiting a design flaw in the interview session webpage. The idea for my project was inspired by a repo I found called [firevue](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue) which was authored by [lightflix](https://github.com/lightflix). My project expands on lightflix's work by using a novel approach to access the interviw questions with mininal user input.
## Functionality
The module is composed of 2 main component: a webscraper and a Command Line Interface (CLI). 

The webscraper part uses `requests` to access a JSON file that contains the interview questions. Then it uses the `json` module to parse the JSON file for each question and its recording parameters (e.g. response and preparation times). For some user's the question's have rail fence encryption, so a refactored version of lightflix's ([decryption algorithm](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue/blob/main/firevue.py)) is used.

Once the questions and recording parameters have been parsed and cleaned, they are sent to the CLI component where are formatted for visual display. The `argparse` module is used to create the CLI.
