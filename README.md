### Requirements: 
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Hirevue interview URL (i.e. the link that brings you to your interview session)
## Installation

1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download a stable version of python.<sup>1, 2</sup>

    - WINDOWS USERS: Make sure to the check **Add python.exe to PATH** box on the installation wizard. 

2. Download the [HirevueExploit](https://github.com/agarcia50S/HirevueExploit) repo.
   - green Code button -> Download ZIP button

3. Extract the files from the ZIP folder and save the 2 modules in the same directory.
## Program
1. Open your machine's terminal
2. Navigate to the directory that contains `view_questions` and `main`. 
    - On macOS and Windows you use the `cd` argument to open directories
    - e.g. If path is C:\Users\ag\my-stuff\HirevueExploit you would do `cd my-stuff/HirevueExploit`

3. To have the program display the questions in the terminal enter `python main.py HIREVUE LINK --display`
    - If questions look weird add to the statement `--encrypted`
    - See [CLI documentation]() to learn more about the program's additional functionality
### WARNING: 
Refrain from spam-running the program as your potential employer may have access to the number of times your interview session was accessed.
## Encrypted Questions
Some questions might be encrypted with the [rail fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher) cipher. The cipher's key is 2 and its offset is 1. The encryption scheme might change in the future, if it does I recommend first messing around with the key and offset by using the [crpytii website](https://cryptii.com/pipes/rail-fence-cipher). 
## Project Summary
The purpose of this repo is to help you prepare for a Hirevue one-way video interview by providing you with the questions that will be asked. Hirevue's interview-session page contains a design that the program exploits to gain access to the interview questions prior to the interview. The idea for my project was inspired by a repo I found called [firevue](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue) which was authored by [lightflix](https://github.com/lightflix). My project expands on lightflix's work by using a novel approach to access the interviw questions with mininal user input.
## Program Functionality
The module is composed of 2 main component: a webscraper and a Command Line Interface (CLI). 

The webscraper part uses `requests` to access a JSON file that contains the interview questions. Then it uses the `json` module to parse the JSON file for each question and its recording parameters (e.g. response and preparation times). For some users, the questions are rail-fence encrypted, so a refactored version of lightflix's ([decryption algorithm](https://github.com/lightflix/firevue/blob/main/firevue.py)) is used.

Once the questions and recording parameters have been parsed and cleaned, they are sent to the CLI component. The CLI gives the user control over the program; it provides a variety of options that allow the user alter the program's functionality (e.g. display quesions, save questions, alter the GET request, and more). The `argparse` module is used to create the CLI.
